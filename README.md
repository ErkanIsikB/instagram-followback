# instagram-followback
Find accounts who do not follow you back on instagram

This script allows you to analyze your Instagram followers and following directly from your browser's console. It identifies users who don't follow you back and those you don't follow back. It works by fetching data from Instagram's internal APIs while you're logged into your account.

How to Use

Log into Instagram:
Open Instagram in your browser and log into your account.

Open Developer Tools:
Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + Shift + I or F12.
Mac: Press Cmd + Option + I.
Alternatively, right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect.

Go to the Console Tab:
In the Developer Tools window, navigate to the Console tab.

Paste the Code:
Copy the script below and paste it into the console. Replace "username" with the Instagram username you want to analyze (If you want to analyze a private account, the account you logged in with should follow them).

Run the Script:
Press Enter to execute the script. The script will fetch and analyze the follower/following data.

View Results:
The script will log the results to the console.
To export the data, type copy(ghosters) or copy(unnoticedFans) in the console and paste it into a text editor.
